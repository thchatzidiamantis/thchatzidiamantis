I am a master's student in mathematics at the University of Bonn interested in all things mathematical logic, especially if category theory is involved. 

I'm currently working on my thesis on simplicial homotopy type theory, supervised by [Nima Rasekh](https://guests.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/rasekh/) and [Floris van Doorn](http://florisvandoorn.com/).

### Formalization 
* I've worked with [Lean](http://lean-lang.org) for a [course](https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse23/) in Bonn and [formalized Fodor's lemma](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/LeanCourse23/tree/master/LeanCourse/Project), a set-theoretic property of a special class of "big" sets.
* As part of my thesis project I'm learning [Rzk](https://rzk-lang.github.io/rzk/en/v0.7.4/), a proof assistant designed for synthetic âˆž-catrgories. Anything interesting I do with it will be here.

### Notes
* [Introductory notes on equivariant orthogonal spectra](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/Notes/blob/main/equivariant/equivariant.pdf), for a graduate seminar in Bonn.
More to appear shortly!
