I'm a first year PhD student at the University of Western Ontario interested in all things mathematical logic, especially if category theory and (homotopy) type theory are involved. My supervisor is [Dan Christensen](https://jdc.math.uwo.ca/). Before that, I wrote my master's thesis on simplicial homotopy type theory at the University of Bonn, supervised by [Nima Rasekh](https://guests.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/rasekh/) and [Floris van Doorn](http://florisvandoorn.com/). [Here](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/MscThesis/blob/main/SubmissionText.pdf) is the "finished" product.

### Formalisation of mathematics
* As part of my master's thesis project I started working with [Rzk](https://rzk-lang.github.io/rzk), a proof assistant designed for synthetic âˆž-catrgories. Everything I'm doing with it is [here](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/sHoTT). I recently started an experimental Rzk project about [2-Segal types](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/sHoTT/blob/2Segal/src/2Segal/2segal-types.rzk.md). It's just like Segal types, only the combinatorics are worse in every way and it's not as useful. Convinced yet?
* I've worked with [Lean](http://lean-lang.org) for a [course](https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse23/) taught by Floris van Doorn in Bonn and [formalized Fodor's lemma](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/LeanCourse23/tree/master/LeanCourse/Project), a set-theoretic property of a special class of "big" sets.

### Notes
* [Introductory notes on equivariant orthogonal spectra](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/Notes/blob/main/equivariant/equivariant.pdf), for a graduate seminar in Bonn.
* Together with Kunhong Du and Tim Lichtnau, we are giving a series of introductory talks on topics in homotopy type theory, as part of our thesis work. [Here](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/BonnHoTTSeminar) are the notes.
