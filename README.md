I am a master's student in mathematics at the University of Bonn interested in all things mathematical logic, especially if category theory is involved. I'm currently working on my thesis on simplicial homotopy type theory, supervised by [Nima Rasekh](https://guests.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/rasekh/) and [Floris van Doorn](http://florisvandoorn.com/).

Starting September 2024, I will be a PhD student at the University of Western Ontario.

### Formalization 
* I've worked with [Lean](http://lean-lang.org) for a [course](https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse23/) taught by Floris van Doorn in Bonn and [formalized Fodor's lemma](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/LeanCourse23/tree/master/LeanCourse/Project), a set-theoretic property of a special class of "big" sets.
* As part of my thesis project I'm learning [Rzk](https://rzk-lang.github.io/rzk/en/v0.7.4/), a proof assistant designed for synthetic âˆž-catrgories. Everything I'm doing with it is [here](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/sHoTT). I just started an experimental Rzk project about [2-Segal types](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/sHoTT/blob/2Segal/src/2Segal/2segal-types.rzk.md). It's currently basically empty, but not for long (I hope)!

### Notes
* [Introductory notes on equivariant orthogonal spectra](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/Notes/blob/main/equivariant/equivariant.pdf), for a graduate seminar in Bonn.
* Together with Kunhong Du and Tim Lichtnau, we are giving a series of introductory talks on topics in homotopy type theory, as part of our thesis work. [Here](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/BonnHoTTSeminar) are the notes.
