I am a master's student in mathematics at the University of Bonn interested in all things mathematical logic, especially if category theory is involved. I just finished working on my thesis on simplicial homotopy type theory, supervised by [Nima Rasekh](https://guests.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/rasekh/) and [Floris van Doorn](http://florisvandoorn.com/) a copy of which you can find [here](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/MscThesis/blob/main/SubmissionText.pdf).

Starting September 2024, I will be a PhD student at the University of Western Ontario.

### Formalization 
* I've worked with [Lean](http://lean-lang.org) for a [course](https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse23/) taught by Floris van Doorn in Bonn and [formalized Fodor's lemma](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/LeanCourse23/tree/master/LeanCourse/Project), a set-theoretic property of a special class of "big" sets.
* As part of my thesis project I started working with [Rzk](https://rzk-lang.github.io/rzk/en/v0.7.4/), a proof assistant designed for synthetic âˆž-catrgories. Everything I'm doing with it is [here](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/sHoTT). I recently started an experimental Rzk project about [2-Segal types](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/sHoTT/blob/2Segal/src/2Segal/2segal-types.rzk.md). It's just like Segal types, only the combinatorics are worse in every way and it's not as useful. Convinced yet?

### Notes
* [Introductory notes on equivariant orthogonal spectra](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/Notes/blob/main/equivariant/equivariant.pdf), for a graduate seminar in Bonn.
* Together with Kunhong Du and Tim Lichtnau, we are giving a series of introductory talks on topics in homotopy type theory, as part of our thesis work. [Here](https://github.com/thchatzidiamantis/BonnHoTTSeminar) are the notes.
